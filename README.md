## DUNE Sterile Neutrino Sensitivity Analysis ðŸ”¬

This repository contains the C code and analysis scripts developed during Career Develepmont Summer Programme at the University of Edinburgh mainly in May, June and July but with some work till September. The project aims to forecast the sensitivity of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to the oscillation parameters of a 3+1 sterile neutrino model. The simulations are performed using the **GLoBES (General Long Baseline Experiment Simulator)** library.

## Abstract

The Standard Model describes neutrino oscillations with three massive neutrino states. However, some experimental anomalies (such as that at LSND - the `reactor anomaly') hint at the possible existence of additional, non-weakly-interacting neutrinos, known as "sterile" neutrinos. In this project, we investigate the potential of the DUNE experiment to probe a simple extension of the Standard Model with one sterile neutrino (the 3+1 model). By simulating the propagation of neutrinos from LBNF at Fermilab (near Chicago) to the Sanford Underground Research Facility (Arizona), as the final part to this project we calculate the sensitivity of DUNE to the sterile mixing angle $\theta_{24}$ and the new mass-squared splitting $\Delta m^2_{41}$. Read the [report](./Report.pdf) for more information.

## Key Features

-   **DUNE Simulation:** Implements the DUNE experimental setup, including baseline, detector mass, and beam power configurations.
-   **Sterile Neutrino Model (3+1):** Uses C code to define the oscillation probabilities in a four-neutrino framework.
-   **Sensitivity Calculation:** Leverages the GLoBES library to perform a $\chi^2$ statistical analysis.
-   **Parameter Scans:** Includes Makefiles and scripts to perform scans over sterile neutrino oscillation parameters.

## Prerequisites

Before you can compile and run this code, you will need the following installed on your system:

1.  **A C Compiler:** A standard C compiler like `gcc` or `clang`.
2.  **Make:** The `make` build automation tool.
3.  **GLoBES Library:** This code is entirely dependent on GLoBES.
    -   You must have it installed and compiled.
    -   Ensure that the environment variables (e.g., `$GLB_DIR`) are set correctly in your shell configuration (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.).
    -   Official website for installation: [GLoBES Homepage](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/globes/)
4.  **Plotting Software (Optional):** To visualize the results, you'll need a tool like **gnuplot**, **ROOT**, **Mathematic** or **Python** (with Matplotlib/NumPy which is what is used in this projects).

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/paolominhas/DUNE-GLoBES-Simulation-Internship.git](https://github.com/paolominhas/DUNE-GLoBES-Simulation-Internship.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Verify GLoBES Installation:**
    Confirm that your GLoBES installation is working and that the necessary environment variables are loaded into your current shell session.

---

## Usage ðŸš€

The project is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific parameter scan. To run a simulation:

1.  **Navigate to a simulation directory:**
    ```bash
    # Example for scanning the theta_34 mixing angle
    cd ./simulation_theta34/
    ```

2.  **Compile the code:**
    The Makefile is configured to find your GLoBES installation and link against the required libraries.
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This will create an executable file (e.g., `run_scan`).

3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./run_scan
    ```

4.  **Check the Output:**
    The program will generate `.dat` or `.txt` files in the `../results/` directory. These files contain the $\chi^2$ values for the parameter points scanned.

## Results

The output data is contained in the [report](./Report.pdf). A current silly limitation of this repository is that I didnt save the plots so in the future hopefully htis will be amended.
